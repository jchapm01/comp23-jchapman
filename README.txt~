***What has been correctly implemented:

ip_addresses.py: Since this program prints out every possible IP address
		 (4 3-digit numbers separated by a . with each number
		 in the range [0, 255] inclusive), it has been implemented
		 correctly.
reverselist.py: I hard-coded a simple list in the program itself,
		and just used the .reverse() python function to
		reverse the list. It prints out in reverse order
		as expected.
word_count.py: This prints out every unique word in a given input file,	
	       with its corresponding frequency in the file itself,
	       and the total number of words in the original file
	       (including the multiples of a unique word).


***I don't believe I implemented anything incorrectly.


***Collaborated with Jared Bronen

***I spent approximately 2 hours completing Lab 2
