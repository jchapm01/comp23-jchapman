1. I believe everything has been implemented correctly. 
Interacting with the chest (locked/unlocked, closed/open) is not
as straightforward as I would have liked (you can lock an open chest
and other weird combinations), but the player can successfully win the game
(putting all 5 mementos in the chest and locking it) with no issues
with respect to this. 

2. Collaborated with Jared Bronen

3. Approx. hours spent: 7
