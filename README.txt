Lab 4 - The Battle for Ram Aras, Part II
Date: 3/4/2014

Implementation:
	I believe I implemented everything correctly except the sidescrolling.
Because I pass in my background image to my battlecruiser and laser
objects, and due to time constraints, I was unable to implement
the sidescrolling background (like in Background.py in the sidescrolling
folder, in your examples) correctly in time for submission.
	Other than this, running python Enemy.py has all 10
sprites bouncing off of the walls on a white background, and game.py
is a playable version of the Battle for Ram Aras with the correct
sounds played and the gifs of the enemies change when a laser hits them.
Also, I implemented a Game Loop and an End of Game Loop to ensure that
when the game is over, a end-game screen is visible and no more
updates, drawing/rendering, or collision detection happens for
the sprites.
